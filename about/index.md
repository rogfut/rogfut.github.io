I am a system administrator who works and lives in the Seattle area.  I have a passion for PowerShell and DevOps.  

In DevOps and in the IT industry, there is so much information out there that learning is a non-stop adventure.  There is such an abundance of information that it can sometimes be overwhelming.  

My mission is to help others learn something new about DevOps practices, culture, and tools by sharing the experiences and information that helped me.
