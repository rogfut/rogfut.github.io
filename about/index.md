I'm an IT engineer living in the Greater Seattle Area.  I'd describe myself as an IT generalist as I've been in a variety of different roles from QA & Systems Administration to Identity Management .  In my spare time, I like to learn to program & play video games.  I'm currently working on FreeCodeCamp's full stack development course, check out my Portfolio!
